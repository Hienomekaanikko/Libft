# 🏛️ Libft: Building a Custom C Library from Scratch

Libft is an introductory project for students at Hive Helsinki, designed to develop a personal C library. This library will be essential as students progress through their studies, continually expanding with new functionalities as needed.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Create a Custom C Library**: Recreate standard C library functions from scratch, gaining a deep understanding of their inner workings.
- **Prepare for Future Projects**: The library serves as a foundation for upcoming projects, emphasizing the importance of robust and reusable code.

## 🚀 Why Build Functions from Scratch?

Building each function independently offers valuable insights into their use cases and limitations. It equips students with the knowledge to quickly and safely resolve issues in future scenarios.

## 🏆 Challenges Faced

- **Efficient Function Recycling**: Reusing functions within the library efficiently has been a significant challenge.
- **Impact of Poor Implementation**: A poorly constructed library can cause issues in subsequent projects, highlighting the need for careful planning and execution.

## 🔧 Key Features of Libft

- **Recreation of Standard Functions**: Includes functions for string manipulation, memory management, and more.
- **Custom Implementations**: Functions are prefixed with `ft_` to distinguish them from standard library functions.
- **Rigorous Testing**: Ensures that functions handle all possible edge cases and scenarios.

## 📌 Conclusion

Libft is more than just a project; it's a learning journey that enhances understanding of C programming. By building this library, students not only master the functions but also develop skills in problem-solving and efficient coding practices.
