Libft is the first project for the students in Hive Helsinki. The idea is to make our own C library from scratch, which will become handy as we proceed in the studies. The library will expand as I
move forward in the studies and come in need of more functionalities.

Why to make ALL of the functions from scratch? I imagine it's just a really good way to get to know these functions and use-cases like our own pockets! When situations occur in the future, 
I'll (hopefully) know exactly what would solve them faster and safely. 

The biggest challenge so far in creating this, has been 
efficiently recycling the functions i've already included
in the library. 

When this project is done poorly, it will come back to bite you
because as previously stated, this library will be used in
the upcoming projects
